#### CNN - Recognition-using-Deep-Networks

In this project, I trained my machine to learn what are numbers and greek letters by convolutional neural network(CNN).  

#### GAN DCGAN cGAN - Generative and Adversarial Network

Developed with Pytorch, the codes are to generate handwritten digit letters and color images, and study the differences and performances between general GAN, cGAN, DCGAN.

#### Kaggle Paddy Disease Detection

Developed with Pytorch, the codes are to detect paddy field healtiness and which kind of sickness.
